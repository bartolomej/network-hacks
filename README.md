# Network hacks

A few scripts made for fun to explore network protocols.

### FTP bruteforce

This script automatically scans for hosts with open FTP ports on your network 
using [nmap](https://nmap.org/) and launches a bruteforce attack using [Hydra tool](https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra). Common passwords & usernames dataset is taken from [SecList](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
